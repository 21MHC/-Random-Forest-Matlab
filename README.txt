Andrej's Machine Learning toolbox 
by Andrej Karpathy (@karpathy)

See attached forestdemo.m for how to use random forest implementation.
This is not an industrial strength implementation but is meant more for
research purposes and fun. However, it's possible I'll want to speed this
up in near future and make it more robust.

Currently can be used for discrete classification task, but planning to 
extend this to regression, density modeling, etc etc.

Inspired by MSR's recent work on Random Forests:

See http://cs.stanford.edu/~karpathy/randomForestSpiral.png
for what current spiral with this looks like, using conic weak learner.
I think Microsoft's visualization is nicer :)
